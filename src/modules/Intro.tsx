        No one has ever seen the climate but we all watch the weather. Through the weather we live
        and breathe and have our being. Or at least “we” used to. Most of “us” are secular now, no
        longer dependent on such heavenly entities as sun, rain, frost, snow, heat, cold, wind,
        cloud, drought, or storm for our living and breathing and being. “We” watch the weather
        channel in apolitical bliss, its measurements and predictions little more than an amusement
        or an inconvenience.
      </p>
      <p>We worry about the politics of climate change but forget the politics of weather.</p>
      <p>
        This project dwells on the politics of weather through videos made by Mam Mayan
        interlocutors in San Juan Atitán, Guatemala. Given an open prompt, they did not share with
        us, the viewer, the predicted ravages of climate change, nor did they show the destruction
        wrought by recent hurricanes. Rather, they shared the dignity and beauty of their everyday
        lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not learn directly about temperature, precipitation, or humidity. Rather you will
        be shown how people in a Mayan town live with their weather through farming, foraging,
        cooking, weaving, and other daily activities. They may seem quotidian, mundane even. But
        these embodied practices of living with the weather cultivate life.
